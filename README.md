# Portfolio-Website
This is my first website created by me. Its not a perfect piece of work but its good for a start. 

I'm still learning Javascript so i cant embed javascript into the site.

As i had to implement my web dvelopment knowledge into creating some real project,I chose to made a portfolio site
It was my first time adding bootstrap components into the site, I used Bootstrap Carousels and a lot of Bootstrap utility for this work.

For some reason site was not displaying on Github-Pages . So i deployed it on other platform.

Here is the link for the site.
